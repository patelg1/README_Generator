## Description
This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file. This file is created from a user's input using [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). The application asks the user to input the project title, project description, installation instructions, project usage, contribution credits, license, and tests. After the inputs are placed a README.md file is generated with all of the information as well as a Table of Contents and Questions sections. 

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
